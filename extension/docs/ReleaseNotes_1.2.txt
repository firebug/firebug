Firebug 1.1 is Firebug 1.05 by Joe Hewitt with additions by John J. Barton and Max Stepanov

== Enablement UI ==
    * Disable always: when the Firebug UI is not active on any page, the debugger is disabled (minimal overhead)
    * Instant on: when the Firebug UI is active, HTML, CSS, DOM views activate (minimal overhead)
    * Script panel user-activation: initially disabled or enabled always
    * Net panel user-activiation: initially disabled or enabled always
    * Console panel user-activation: initially disabled or enabled always. Controls ShowXMLHTTPRequest, consoleListener
    * Bug Icon gray unless some page has Script or Net panel activation
    * Multipanel enablement.
    * No Allowed-sites/Disable for Site: no longer needed.
    * Suspend/Resume Firebug in status bar context menu
    * List pages that enable Firebug on the Context menu tooltip.
  The UI for this feature is being refined; overhead tests have not been completed.
  We are interested in feedback on this UI change.

== Javascript Debugging ==
    * Written/cleaned up eval support
    * Performance on eval better, easier to support.
  This feature is complete; Bug reports on javascript debugger welcome.

== Net Panel ==
    * Net timing more accurate
    * Only real network requests displayed.
    * Limit for number of requests (configurable in preferences).
    * Additional columns for: request method, status response + text
    * Cache tab has expiration time in Net panel
    * The Response tab has a hack to prevent extra requests to the server. Users must click on a button to force the request. 
      The hack will not be needed in the next release of Firebug.

== Console ==
    * Redesigned to use events/attribute passing.
  tests/console/joes-original/test.html mostly passes

== Command Line ==
    * Redesigned to avoid using evalInSandbox.
  tests/console/commandLineObjects.html mostly passes
  commandLineAPI functions, ok.
