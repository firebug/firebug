In addition there are previews of two features that will ultimately be moved into Honza’s Activation extension:

    * Implement onByDefault option (Firebug > Firebug Icon Menu > Options > On By Default). Firebug will be active on every page, unless you hit “Off”. Once you hit Off on a page, Firebug won’t open for that page until you explicitly turn it on.
    * Implement log activation URIs. (Firebug Status bar icon > Right click > Log Activation URIs). Prints into the Console panel of the seletected web page in the tab browser.
