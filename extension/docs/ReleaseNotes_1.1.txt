Release Notes for Firebug 1.1
Firebug 1.1 is Firebug 1.05 by Joe Hewitt with additions by John J. Barton and Max Stepanov

=== Javascript Debugging ===
* eval() debugging,
  Javascript code sent to eval() shows up in Script as a new source file. Code can be debugged as other source.
  This is esp. important for Web 2.0 script-inclusion as in dojo.loader.
  Implementation of http://www.almaden.ibm.com/u/bartonjj/fireclipse/test/DynLoadTest/WebContent/DynamicJavascriptErrors.htm
  ** Script panel option "Show eval() source": turn false to hide the eval() buffers (there can be many).
  ** Script panel option "UseLastLineForEvalName": set to ask Firebug to use the last
     line of eval() buffer for the name of the buffer:
     //@ sourceURL=<url>
  ** support profiling of eval() scripts
  ** Internal: mostly firebug-service.js, some debugger.js (where the Script panel is implemented)
  **           also created nsIFirebugWithEval.idl extending nsIFirebug.idl

* browser-generated event handler debugging,
  Firefox generates event handler code that is normally invisible to programmers. 1.1 shows these
  handlers in the Script panel and they can be breakpointed etc.
  ** Internal: as eval() debugging.

* executable lines marked with green line numbers,
  ** Internal: lib.js

* Stack side panel on "Script" panel for callstack,
  This is visible when you BreakOnAllErrors or breakpoint and stop the debugger.
  Stack side panel option: Omit Toolbar Stack, causes the toolbar to stop showing the stack (ie because it will be long).
  ** Internal: debugger.js but the implementation was done by refactoring code.

* ScriptPanel->Options->Break On Top Level, like break on next
  When set the next top level script will halt the debugger like a breakpoint.
  Should be similar to the oft-requested Break on Next.
  ** Internal: mostly firebug-service.js, some debugger.js, also changed component interface (.idl and .xpt file)

* limit filenames on locationList (script files) to 60 chars to avoid spilling UI

* "better" debugging icons,
  The original icons made no sense to me so I invent some similar colored ones that I like better.

=== External Edtiors ===
 * External editors configuration, "Open With Editor" menu
 * Aptana IDE editor integration

=== Console, Errors ===
* CSS errors report against source lines,
  CSS error used to report against CSS: but errors cause the CSS to be ignored so the erroneous
  CSS was not even visible.

* BreakOnError puts error text in StatusBar
  BreakOnError halts the debugger but the console has not been updated yet. So you know there
  is an error and even where it is but not the message.  This fix puts the error in red in the StatusBar.

* New Console options
   ShowChromeErrors=Show Chrome Errors
   ShowChromeMessages=Show Chrome Messages
   ShowExternalErrors=Show External Errors

== Net panel ==
* Cache tab for Net panel contributed by Kyle Scholz

== XHR  ==
* Spy was redesigned to avoid wrapping of XMLHttpRequest object that had caused many issues
  An observer for http-on-modify-request events is used
  ** Internal: spy.js

=== Bug Fixes ===
    ** Issue 8: using PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege doesn't work for XHRs
    ** Issue 27: codebrowser does not work, when there is an Java Applet on the page
    ** Issue 69: incorrect enabled on new tabs
    ** Issue 234: console.log displays string objects as arrays
    ** Issue 230 CSS Errors reported on wrong or non-existent line numbers
    ** Issue 181 Net->XHR Response tab shows "Loading..." not response text.
    ** Issue 239 Fix for Frame refresh bug: http://groups.google.com/group/firebug/browse_thread/thread/c69e49b9815b2540
    ** throw exception if firebugService cannot be loaded on startup (_CC[cname] error message).   http://groups.google.com/group/firebug/browse_thread/thread/c795b72931f2bd34/8fa8dca3c012c4f7
    ** Issue 249: Fix for Net monitor memory leaks
    ** Issue 342: debugger breaks on disabled breakpoints

=== General ===

  !Incomplete: HTML + DOM side panel still breaks browser repainting.
  Internal: evalInSandBox introduced.

  Add trace.js for internal Fbug debugging. Add tracePanel.js to control tracing.
  This code is only on branches/explore

* support for Chromebug extension
